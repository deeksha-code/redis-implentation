Redis Installation Guide for Windows 
This guide helps you install Redis locally on a Windows machine and configure it to run as a background service so developers don‚Äôt need to start it manually.
________________________________________
Step 1: Download Redis for Windows
1.	Go to the official Microsoft-archived Redis build:
 üîó https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases

2.	Download this file:
Redis-x64-3.0.504.zip (Stable & commonly used build)

Alternatively, you can access the pre-downloaded setup from the shared drive under the Screener Environment folder.

3.	Extract the zip to a folder, e.g.:
C:\Redis-x64-3.0.504

________________________________________
Step 2: Test Redis Manually (Optional but Recommended)
1.	Open Command Prompt as Administrator

2.	Navigate to the Redis folder:
 cd C:\Redis-x64-3.0.504

3.	Start Redis:
redis-server.exe redis.windows.conf

4.	Open another Command Prompt, navigate to the same folder:
redis-cli.exe
Ping
5.	 You should see: PONG

________________________________________
  Step 3: Install Redis as a Windows Service
1.	Open Command Prompt as Administrator

2.	Run the following:

cd C:\Redis-x64-3.0.504 redis-server --service-install redis.windows.conf --loglevel verbose

3.	 This installs Redis as a Windows service using the config file.


4.	Now start the service:
redis-server --service-start

________________________________________
Step 4: 
Redis Connection Test 
Inside the redis-implementation folder, a basic Node.js script is provided to test whether Redis is successfully installed and running locally.
 Purpose:
‚óè	Verify Redis is reachable and operational.

‚óè	Demonstrate basic usage: connecting, setting, and getting a key-value pair.

Location:
‚óè	File path: redis-implementation/redis-test.js

‚óè	This script is meant to be included as part of the Screener environment setup to help developers validate their local Redis installation.

 How to Use:
1.	Make sure Redis is installed and running (either manually or as a background service).

2.	In the terminal, navigate to this directory:
cd redis-implementation
3.	Run the test script:
node redis-test.js

 Expected Output:
‚óè	Should log:Stored value: deeksha
‚óè	If Redis is not installed or not running, a connection error will be shown in the console.

Notes:
‚óè	This script uses the official redis npm package (npm install redis)

‚óè	Redis must be running on localhost:6379 for the test to succeed.
